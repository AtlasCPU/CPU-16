# CPU-16
My YouTube account is [here](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC0kihtgYtJHA7ZHQloiz2jA), I'll be regularly posting progress videos to it.

The CPU-16 infosheet is [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1oUmNbYWaNhDA6R6yvVTsaPwRNyT6d51xgqEzrvvlCoQ/edit?usp=sharing). It has various pieces of info, such as an instruction set chart

All documentation relating to the CPU-16 has been moved to my website, which is [here](http://techno-sorcery.com/cpu16.html).
